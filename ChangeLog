    * Version 3.2.2:
        Documentation: minor bug fixes

2012-05-28  Christophe Delord <cdsoft.fr>

    * Version 3.2.1:
        Tests: deprecated assertEquals renamed assertEqual

    * Bug fixes:
        - replace print by sys.stderr.write in the verbose
          parser to avoid encoding issues.

2012-05-18  Christophe Delord <cdsoft.fr>

    * Version 3.2.0:
        reStructuredText support

    * New features:
        - in grammar docstring the text before a line ended
          with '::' is ignored. This allows a grammar to be
          embeded in a reStructuredText formated docstring.

2004-11-20  Christophe Delord <cdsoft.fr>

    * Version 3.0.4:
        Bug fix

    * Bug fix:
        - Check regular expressions before building the lexer
        in order to detect incorrect tokens in a more explicit
        way (thanks to Laszlo Kalman for reporting the bug).
        - Check Python code before compiling the parser
        in order to detect Python syntax errors in a more
        explicit way too.

2004-04-08  Christophe Delord <cdsoft.fr>

    * Version 3.0.3:
        Bug fix

    * Bug fix:
        - Empty sequences are authorized only in the last branch
        of alternatives (thanks to Laszlo Kalman for reporting
        the bug).

2004-03-15  Christophe Delord <cdsoft.fr>

    * Version 3.0.2:
        Bug fix

    * Bug fix:
        - Word boundaries not added when only the beginning of the
        token looks like a word. TPG can now handle tokens like
        'http:' (thanks to Reinhard Gantar for reporting the bug).

2004-01-18  Christophe Delord <cdsoft.fr>

    * Version 3.0.1:
        Minor bug fixes
        More unit tests

2003-11-11  Christophe Delord <cdsoft.fr>

    * Version 3.0.0:
        This is a complete rewrite of TPG 2 in order to simplify
        the parser and the code generator. The syntax is also
        incompatible with TPG 2.

    * New features:
        - The grammar of parsers is the doc string of the class.
        - Syntax of expressions improved and simplified.
        - The word_boundary option tells TPG to use or not
        automatic word boundaries (\b) around identifier like
        tokens (thanks to Zeph Grunschlag for the remark).
        - The compilation options of regular expressions can be
        changed for each parser (thanks to Mark Andrew for the
        remark).
        - New lexers have been added (mainly to bypass the limitation
        of the sre package to 100 named groups).
        - Adds debugging facilities (thanks to Mark Andrew again).

    * Bug fixes:
        - I wrote some unit tests and discovered (and fixed) many
        small bugs.

    * tpg.pyg:
        This is the source containing the TPG grammar and generator.

    * tpg.py:
        This is the "compiled" version of tpg.pyg

* Incompatible changes from version 3.0.0
*********************************************************************

2003-05-25  Christophe Delord <cdsoft.fr>

    * Version 2.1.6-dev:
        The first code of the .g file is placed before
        any other code (for __future__ statements).
        Thanks to Rodrigo B. de Oliveira for the comment.
        Some bug fixes.

    * codegen.py:
        Add code before "import tpg.base".

    * parser.g:
        Parse the first code appart.
        Make CSL parser inherits from ToyParserCSL instead
        of ToyParser1 (thanks to Dominic Hillenbrand).

2003-04-20  Christophe Delord <cdsoft.fr>

    * Version 2.1.5:
        Optionnal indent and deindent tokens (indent option).
        Global and local (to a single parser) options.

    * base.py:
        Indent and deindent preprocessor.

    * codegen.py:
        Distinction between global and local options.
        Indent and deindent preprocessor code generation.

    * parser.g:
        Distinction between global and local options.
        Indent and deindent definition.

2002-10-20  Christophe Delord <cdsoft.fr>

    * Version 2.1.4:
        HTML documentation uses the free png image format instead
        of the expensive gif.
        TPG uses spaces instead of tabs.
        TPG now generate Python code instead of source code in
        a string (to check the generated parser as soon as
        possible).

    * codegen.py:
        Indentation uses four spaces instead of a tabulation.
        Bug fix: add a newline on the last line.

    * parser.g:
        The tpg.translate method translates TPG into Python source.
        The tpg.compile method compiles TPG into Python code.

2002-08-22  Christophe Delord <cdsoft.fr>

    * Version 2.1.3:
        Some bug fixes.
        Added the cut operator (!). ! acts as in Prolog, i.e. when
        TPG backtracks on a cut, others alternatives are not tried.
        The main difference with Prolog is that ! immediatly exits
        i.e. it cuts all the pending alternatives (not only the
        innermost). This helps TPG to report errors more precisely.
        Marks are renamed as '@' (was '!' in previous versions)
        LexicalError and SyntaxError have been renamed LexerError
        and ParserError to avoid conflicts.

    * base.py:
        Bug fix: added the *args parameters in ToyParser.__init__
        Improvment: _Scanner.tokens uses lastgroup to find to
        matched token instead of an ugly loop.
        Added the tpg.Error base class for tpg.LexicalError,
        tpg.SyntaxError and tpg.SemanticError.

    * parser.g:
        Better error reporting.
        Added 'Cut' support.
        Added support for keyword arguments, *args and **kw.

    * codegen.py:
        Bug fix: quotes are escaped in strings if necessary
        Added "Cut" support.
        Improvment: Alternative is now generated as a balanced
        tree to allow more alternatives.
        Bug fix: predefined tokens and inline tokens could have
        the same internal name (and re couldn't compile the lexer).
        Added support for keyword arguments, *args and **kw.

2002-08-07  Christophe Delord <cdsoft.fr>

    * Version 2.1.2:
        The context sensitive lexer of TPG 0.1.9 has been
        reintroduced (CSL option). TPG can produce both
        type of lexers.

    * base.py:
        The ToyParserCSL class inherits from ToyParser and
        is the base class for CSL parsers.
        ToyParser and ToyParserCSL classes have a 'init' method
        to provide the user a way to initialize the parser,
        a 'error' method to stop parsing and raise an error
        as a SemanticError exception.

    * codegen.py:
        Parsers, Code, Parser, Rule, Symbol, Sequence,
        Alternative, MakeAST, AddAST, Check, Rep, Mark
        and Extraction InlineToken have been updated to
        generate CSL code.
        LexRule has been added to generate the code for
        lexical rules.
        class Error: code generator for the error keyword.
        Bug fix: Check.collect was buggy

    * parser.g:
        PARSERS, OPTIONS, TOKEN and INLINE_TOKEN updated
        to parse CSL grammars.
        LEX_RULE added to parse lexical rules.
        ATOM updated to parse the 'error' statement.

        with the tpg script (thanks to John Krumpotick)
        Completed Slice class for [x:], [:y] and [:]
        Added Check class (just a shortcut for self.check)

    * parser.g:
        Uses the 'check' shortcut
        Changed INDICE to parse [x:], [:y] and [:] slices
        Changed FACT to parse the 'check' shortcut

2002-07-12  Christophe Delord <cdsoft.fr>

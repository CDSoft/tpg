Description: Toy Parser Generator is a lexical and syntactic parser generator
        for Python. This generator was born from a simple statement: YACC
        is too complex to use in simple cases (calculators, configuration
        files, small programming languages, ...).
        
        TPG can very simply write parsers that are usefull for most every
        day needs (even if it can't make your coffee). With a very clear
        and simple syntax, you can write an attributed grammar that is
        translated into a recursive descendant parser. TPG generated code
        is very closed to the original grammar. This means that the parser
        works "like" the grammar. A grammar rule can be seen as a method
        of the parser class, symbols as method calls, attributes as method
        parameters and semantic values as return values. You can also add
        Python code directly into grammar rules and build abstract syntax
        trees while parsing.

\section{Introduction}

TPG (Toy Parser Generator) is a Python\footnote{Python is a wonderful object oriented programming language available at \url{http://www.python.org}} parser generator.
It is aimed at easy usage rather than performance.
My inspiration was drawn from two different sources.
The first was GEN6. GEN6 is a parser generator created at ENSEEIHT\footnote{ENSEEIHT is the french engineer school (\url{http://www.enseeiht.fr}).} where I studied.
The second was PROLOG\footnote{PROLOG is a programming language using logic. My favorite PROLOG compiler is SWI-PROLOG (\url{http://www.swi-prolog.org}).}, especially DCG\footnote{Definite Clause Grammars.} parsers.
I wanted a generator with a simple and expressive syntax and the generated parser should work as the user expects. So I decided that TPG should be a recursive descendant parser (a rule is a procedure that calls other procedures) and the grammars are attributed (attributes are the parameters of the procedures).
This way TPG can be considered as a programming language or more modestly as Python extension.

\section{Structure of the document}

\begin{description}
\item [Part~\ref{tpg:intro}]
starts smoothly with a gentle tutorial as an introduction.
I think this tutorial may be sufficent to start with TPG.
\item [Part~\ref{tpg:core}]
is a reference documentation. It will detail TPG as much as possible.
\item [Part~\ref{tpg:examples}]
gives the reader some examples to illustrate TPG.
